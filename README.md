# My Dotfiles
This configuration is used for my current workflow. I currently work with Arch
and occasionally Debian WSL2 on a Windows machine.

Please note that in order for this lazy.nvim bootstrap to work properly on Debian,
Neovim v0.10.1 must be built and installed manually. One could use the latest 
version; however, the plugin treesitter has a problem with viewing Golang files 
when any version past v0.10.1 is used currently.
